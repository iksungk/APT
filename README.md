# Attentional Ptycho-Tomography
This is the training code for the deep learning model called Attentional Ptycho-Tomography (APT) for three-dimensional nanoscale X-ray imaging. We aimed for minimizing data acquisition and computation time using machine learning. The paper is originally published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-023-01181-8">Light: Science and Applications</a>, and the arXiv paper is available here.
